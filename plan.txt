# PLAN
1. Create 2 variables to store the player's scores and the computer's scores, a variable to count the number of rounds.
2. A function called "computerPlay" will randomly return either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".
3. Use "prompt()" to get input from the player.
4. Compare the user's input with the computer's selection (I use number instead of string).
5. Based on the rules, decide the result of the current round. Print that result to the screen.
6. Update the player's scores and the computer's scores.
7. If one's scores equals 3, move to Step 9.
8. If not. Move to the next round. Repeat Steps 2-7.
9. After 5 rounds, compare the player's scores and the computer's scores. Who has higher scores win. The game is tied if both have the same scores. 
10. Print the final result to the screen. Ask if the player want to play again.
11. If yes, repeat Steps 1-10.
12. If not, stop the game.
